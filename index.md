### Introduction(As a programmer):
#### Energetic undergraduate student major in Math-Computer Science at UCSD providing strong foundation in software engineering and programming skills across multiple platforms. Sufficient in Java and C++. Aim to solve real world programming problems by utilizing my expertise in math
[README](./README.md)
> My favorite programming language : `Java`

#### PROJECTS
1. Library Seats Reservation System
- Implemented the frontend of frontstage for customers (students) and backstage for administrators using Java FTL (FreeMarker Template Language). Allows users to reserve seats at different times and in different regions of the library. Allows administrators to manage people’s reservations (cancel and add reservations) and restrict some regions.
- Built back-end architecture using Java (Including Java Spring Boot) to implement functionalities including user registration, seat selection by different dates, and library region blocking.
- Used MySQL database to store seats information, users’ information, and reservations.
2. Video Games Reviews Website (Web project)
- Designed the front-end using HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap). Allows users to add and watch reviews of different games.
- Built back-end architecture and environment to interact with front-end and database using JavaScript (including NodeJS and Express). Allow users to add new game pages and add likes to people’s views.
- Used MongoDB to store game information and users’ information.

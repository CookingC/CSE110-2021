#### PROJECTS
##### Library Seats Reservation System
###### ● Implemented the frontend of frontstage for customers (students) and backstage for administrators using Java FTL (FreeMarker Template Language). Allows users to reserve seats at different times and in different regions of the library. Allows administrators to manage people’s reservations (cancel and add reservations) and restrict some regions.
